The goal is to allow the player to use the minetest lua API and write lua script
The goal isn't to introduce a new API to the game

Available commands:
	.lua		run instruction
	.luaclear	clear the environment

Available subcommands for .luac:
	cat
	edit
	exec
	halt
	help
	history
	load
	save
	title
	unregister

Special variables and functions:
	_halt()			halt the running program
	_running_script		access the table which determines if a script is
				running
	require()		even tough this function makes part of the lua
				programming language, it is redefined

Specials contents in mod_storage:
	on_connect

--------

.lua core.display_chat_message('hello world !')


Inspired by LuaCmd, basic_robot_csm
